  <p>In general, you may visit this Web site without providing any personal
information to us. If you choose to provide information voluntarily, we will
use that information in accordance with our data privacy principles and in
accordance with any specific notice given as part of the collection of that
data.</p>

<h4 id="data-privacy-principles">Data privacy principles</h4>

<p>Strategic Data has always recognised the importance of maintaining the
privacy of personal and sensitive information of our employees, clients,
vendors and partners. The nature of our business requires us to collect and
handle such information, and we have a responsibility to protect this
information for as long as it is in our possession. At Strategic Data,
respecting our employees, clients, vendors and partners is a part of our core
values, along with being committed to providing services in an ethical manner.</p>

<p>To support these obligations, Strategic Data has created a set of data
privacy principles, which guide our efforts as they relate to privacy and the
handling and protection of personal and sensitive information.</p>

<p>We respect your privacy by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Offering privacy notices that explain how and why we handle personal
information.</li>
  <li>Respecting your choices about our collection, use and sharing of
information, where appropriate.</li>
  <li>Collecting, using and retaining only personal information that is
relevant and useful to our business interactions and the projects we
undertake for our clients.</li>
  <li>Using reasonable efforts to keep personal information accurate and
up-to-date.</li>
  <li>Limiting access to and disclosure of personal information.</li>
  <li>Retaining only the personal information that is needed to fill our legal
and business obligations.</li>
  <li>Offering you the ability to view and update your personal information,
where appropriate.</li>
  <li>Providing you with an opportunity to ask questions and register
complaints about privacy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strategic Data cares about the privacy of our applicants, employees and
clients. This notice contains information about how we handle your personal
information. We collect and process your personal information for the
following purposes where necessary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to maintain our contractual or business relationship with you,</li>
  <li>for employment-related services where applicable,</li>
  <li>to tell you about the products and services we offer,</li>
  <li>to contact and correspond with you, and</li>
  <li>for the management and defence of legal claims and actions, compliance
with court orders and other legal obligations and regulatory
requirements, and as otherwise permitted by law.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strategic Data may disclose your personal information for these purposes to
other associated entities, affiliates, suppliers, subcontractors who perform
services on our behalf, clients if you are seeking employment, and where we
are otherwise required to do so, such as by court order.</p>

<p>Strategic Data collects, processes and discloses sensitive personal
information only if required to comply with legal obligations or if there is
a compelling business reason to do so, where the disclosure of the
information to our client is an inherent (and notified) part of a project or
with your consent.</p>
